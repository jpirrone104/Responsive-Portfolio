                            Hello! My name is Jen, and I am an aspiring Salesforce Developer. I currently work for Philadelphia-based Clarivate Analytics as a Salesforce Administrator. 
                            I currently work for Clarivate Analytics, a Philadelphia-based company that sells research tools. I have a background in Business Administration, and received my 
                            MBA from Arcadia University in 2014. Before discovering what would later become my career, I tried a little bit of everything; working as a retail store manager, banker, administrative assistant, customer care trainer, and small business owner. 
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            When I am not working, I can usually be found cooking, riding my bike, hiking, or camping. I love spending time outside, traveling to new places, and learning new things. 
                            I am hoping that what I learn in this class can help me achieve my ultimate goal of working remotely on a felxible schedule so I can travel more often (or
                            even work as a 'digital nomad' part-time!).
